PREVIOUS MISSION: 'You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.'   
   
MISSION PART TWO: Your Weather App feels pretty solid right now. It works, and it does its job well. But you want to publish the code publicly and use it to show your skills to potential employers. There is some work that needs to be done ðŸ¦¾

## Motivation

We are rewriting our weather-app in modern Javascript. In this way, we learn new skills such as JavaScript Modules, Package Manager, Linters & Formatters.

## Details

Day 1 - Refactor   
Reorganize (refactor) the code in as many functions as you can.   
   
Day 2 - JavaScript Modules  
Divide your code into multiple files for better organization, and import/export things (functions, variables, classes) from one file to another.  
   
Day 3 - Modules and the Browser 
Use the bundler webpack to bundle your JavaScript files.  

Day 4 - Package Manager 
Get to know the package manager npm (Node Package Manager).
